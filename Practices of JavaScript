# JavaScript Practice Code Repository

## Introduction
This repository contains various JavaScript practice codes categorized by different concepts and functionalities. These cover fundamental and intermediate-level JavaScript programming concepts.

## Code Categories

### 1. Object Manipulation
- Creating and displaying objects.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  const product = {
      name: "ballpen",
      ratings: 4,
      offer: 5,
      price: 270
  };
  console.log(product);
  ```

### 2. Conditional Statements
- Checking if a number is even or odd.
- Checking divisibility by 5.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  let num = 5;
  if (num % 2 === 0) {
      console.log("Number is even");
  } else {
      console.log("Number is odd");
  }
  ```

### 3. Loops and Iterations
- Sum of numbers from 1 to `n`.
- Finding even numbers from 0 to 100.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  let sum = 0;
  for (let num = 1; num <= 10; num++) {
      sum += num;
  }
  console.log("The total sum is:", sum);
  ```

### 4. Guessing Game
- Simple guessing game until correct number is guessed.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  let gameNum = 78;
  let userNum = prompt("Guess the number");
  while (userNum != gameNum) {
      userNum = prompt("Wrong guess, try again!");
  }
  console.log("Correct! The number is 78.");
  ```

### 5. String Manipulation
- Username generator with string length.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  let userName = prompt("Enter your full name");
  let fullName = '@' + userName + userName.length;
  console.log("Preferred username:", fullName);
  ```

### 6. Arrays and Array Operations
- Finding sum and average of student marks.
- Applying discounts on prices.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  let marks = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60];
  let sum = marks.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);
  let avg = sum / marks.length;
  console.log(`Average marks: ${avg}`);
  ```

### 7. Higher-Order Functions
- Filtering, mapping, and reducing arrays.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  let numbers = [90, 87, 67, 99, 92, 68];
  let highMarks = numbers.filter(val => val >= 90);
  console.log(highMarks);
  ```

### 8. Arrow Functions
- Multiplication using arrow functions.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
  console.log(multiply(3, 4));
  ```

### 9. Factorial and Sum using Reduce
- Sum and factorial calculations using `reduce`.
- Example:
  ```javascript
  let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  let sum = arr.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);
  let factorial = arr.reduce((acc, val) => acc * val, 1);
  console.log(`Sum: ${sum}, Factorial: ${factorial}`);
  ```
